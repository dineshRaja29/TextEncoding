We will explore various ways to encode text (conversion of text into numeric vector/scaler) from classical to state of art approach. There are broadly four methods which are extensively used in ML/DL 

* BoW using SkLearn + Sparse Matrices
* TF-IDF using SkLearn
* Word2Vec using Gensim
* BERT using bert-serving library + APIs.
